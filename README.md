# GLB to STL Converter

This project provides a Python script to convert GLB files to STL files using the Aspose.3D library.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Aspose.3D library

## Installation

1. Install the Aspose.3D library using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install aspose-3d
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your GLB file in the `Downloads` directory.
2. Run the conversion script:
   ```bash
   python convert_glb_to_stl.py
   ```
3. The converted STL file will be saved in the `output` folder with the same base name as the input GLB file.

## Example

If you have a GLB file named `780de11f-2099-4110-9acd-2e24f8df1f6c.glb`, running the script will produce an STL file named `780de11f-2099-4110-9acd-2e24f8df1f6c.stl` in the `output` folder.
